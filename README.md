# Pitch detection  
This project was part of bachelor thesis created in 2018/2019 at CTU FEE with RNDr. Ondřej Žára as the advisor. The main goal of this bachelor thesis is to design and implement a mobile web application that will analyze the audio signal in real time. This analysis is then used as a guitar tuner. The application is based on solving the problem of pitch detection by two methods -- autocorrelation and fast Fourier transform. The final version of this application uses both of these methods to recognize the fundamental frequency.

Because of the changes in Web Audio API and GetUserMedia API (context of browser privacy), this project is not working correctly right now.
